# Song-Recommendation-System
This project is a **web-based Spotify Song Recommendation System** that uses machine learning algorithms and the Spotify API to deliver personalized music suggestions. Built with Python, Flask, and scikit-learn, it leverages cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, fuzzy matching for user inputs, and a responsive HTML/CSS frontend featuring dark mode. Key features include flexible song and artist search, real-time metadata enrichment, and diverse recommendations for enhanced music discovery, making it ideal for both academic and personal use.[1]
